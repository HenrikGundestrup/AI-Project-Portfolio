📉 Customer Churn Prediction

Goal:
Predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscription to help businesses take proactive retention actions (discounts, loyalty programs, personalized outreach).

💡 Business Context

Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue and growth.
By identifying at-risk customers before they leave, a company can target them with tailored offers — improving retention and reducing acquisition costs.

Example:
Reducing churn by just 5% can increase profits by 25–95% in subscription-based industries.

⚙️ Project Overview

Approach:

Data preprocessing — clean, encode, and normalize customer data

Modeling — compare models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Evaluation — use precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC

Explainability — interpret key churn drivers using SHAP values

Deployment (optional) — visualize churn risk in a Streamlit dashboard

🧠 Key Insights (Example)
Insight	Business Value
Month-to-month contracts lead to higher churn	Promote annual plans
High monthly charges increase churn risk	Offer personalized discounts
Long-tenure customers rarely churn	Prioritize new customers for engagement

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP

Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
